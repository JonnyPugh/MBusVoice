# Thoughts to be done but probably not in MVP1
 - entire datalist for home and destination stops all display and fill screen
 	- fix here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15097563/limit-total-entries-displayed-by-datalist
 - Make UI not look terrible (side by side divs & such)
 - get_favorites endpoint is based on the session['alexaID'] and cannot be used for general purpose access, consider amending this

# Things to do
 - Convert comment scaffolding/skeleton code to database calls and api wrapper interaction
 - add logo to webapp
 - sessions are not ending when python server goes down
 	- do we want to officially end sessions
 - prevent form submission if the stopname is not from the api
 - use api responses to bring up alerts (bootswatch)
