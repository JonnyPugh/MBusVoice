# Thoughts to be done but not in MVP1
 - entire datalist for home and destination stops all display and fill screen
 	- fix here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15097563/limit-total-entries-displayed-by-datalist

# Things to do
 - seperate error logic in index.html into new html file to be returned in main.py
 - display existing user preferences
 	- render data in jinja
 	- get from database object (can just have fill-in data at the moment)
 - write endpoints to accept forms
 	- check reqs for reqs
 	- check that posted alexaid is also session value?
 - 2 endpoints files
 	- one for creating new user data (post_favorites.py)
 	- one for editing/deleting user data (edit_favorites.py)
