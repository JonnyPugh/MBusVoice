# Thoughts to be done but not in MVP1
 - entire datalist for home and destination stops all display and fill screen
 	- fix here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15097563/limit-total-entries-displayed-by-datalist

# Things to do
 - display existing user preferences
 	- convert skeleton data providing functions to actual databse calls
 - write endpoints to accept forms
 	- check requirements documents for requirements
 	- check that posted alexaid is also session value?
 - 2 endpoints files
 	- one for creating new user data (post_favorites.py)
 	- one for editing/deleting user data (edit_favorites.py)
 - sessions don't seem to be expiring properly (may have had two servers, not sure)
