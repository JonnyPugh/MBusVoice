# Thoughts to be done but probably not in MVP1
 - entire datalist for home and destination stops all display and fill screen
 	- fix here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15097563/limit-total-entries-displayed-by-datalist
 - Make UI not look terrible (side by side divs & such)
 - prevent form submission if the stopname is not from the api
 - use api responses to bring up alerts (bootswatch)

# Things to do
 - Convert comment scaffolding/skeleton code to database calls and api wrapper interaction
 	- needs
 		- does this user already exist in the database (get could also just return None if record does not exit)
 		- create user record
 		- set user record (probably same as create user)
 		- get user record
 	- fxns could be
 		- check (could be dropped)
 		- get
 		- put
 - what do we want the webapp to show in the list of users stops if it is empty?
 - Update ajax call to reload user info upon success
 - add logo to webapp


# Things I'm waiting for
 - database wrapper interface
 - access to api wrapper object
